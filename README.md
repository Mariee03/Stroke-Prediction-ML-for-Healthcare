# Stroke Prediction – ML for Healthcare 🧠🫀

A machine learning classification model designed to predict the risk of stroke based on demographic and clinical features. The goal is to assist in early identification of high-risk individuals and support preventive medical strategies.

## 📌 Overview
- Built a supervised learning model to classify stroke risk
- Trained and evaluated multiple classifiers (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest)
- Achieved strong performance in terms of accuracy and recall
- Focused on healthcare applicability and explainability

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

## 📊 Key Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding)
- Feature engineering and exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Model training and evaluation using classification metrics
- Visualizations: Confusion matrix, ROC curve, feature importance

## 🚀 How to Run

### 1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mariee03/Stroke-Prediction-ML-for-Healthcare.git
cd Stroke-Prediction-ML-for-Healthcare
```
### 2. Open the notebook in Jupyter:
```bash
jupyter notebook stroke_prediction_notebook.ipynb
```
### 3. Run all cells to explore and reproduce the model results.

## 📎 Dataset

Based on a publicly available stroke dataset from Kaggle
